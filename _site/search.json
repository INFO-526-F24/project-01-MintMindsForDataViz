The data set is 271,116 rows by 15 columns and contains data for every Olympic medal winner such as their name, sex, country, height, weight, and games they won the medal at.\nIt is important to note that winter and summer games were held in the same year up until 1992. From 1992 onward they were staggered by two years.\n\n\nBig Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)\nBit tech stock price dataset from 2023-02-07 tidytuesday. The data has 45089 rows and 8 columns. Rows has the stock stock symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj close, volume from 2010-01-04 to 2022-12-29 of the following companies: Adobe Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Salesforce, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Alphabet Inc., IBM, Intel Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Netflix, Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Tesla, Inc.\n\n\nAmazon Sales Report (Amazon Sales.csv)\nWe have taken this dataset from kaggle/e-commerce-sales-data, by Anil, and data belongs to Amazon.com. This dataset has 128975 rows and 24 column of data. This dataset provides detailed insights into Amazon sales data, including SKU Code, Design Number, Stock, Category, Size and Color, to help visualization of profitability. The dataset tracks transactions made by customers in an online retail store to analyze purchasing behavior and identify sales trends."

(medal count over time / gold medals over time)\n\n\n\nBig Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)\n\nIs there any relationship between daily volatility open price and close price with the volume of stocks?\n\n\nThis question is important because it can help trader to understand the relationship between the volume of stocks and the daily volatility of the stock price.\n\n\ndo closing price of stock of Big Tech companies correlate with each other over time?\n\n\nThis question is important because it provides traders insights of closing prices of Big Tech companies related to volume of stock, it will help them to make investment decisions.\n\n\n\nAmazon Sales Report (Amazon Sales.csv)\n\nWhat is the distribution of order statuses, and which status is the most common?\nWhat are the top three product categories with the highest total sales amount?"

We will investigate the distributions of height and weight of athletes across different sports and sexes. We can also investigate if so-called “ideal” heights and weights have changed over time for each event. This question has the potential to raise ethical concerns in that anyone is able to succeed in any sport no matter their height/weight. We just want to investigate whether or not there is a historical trend of success across different events in athletes with certain heights/weights.\nOlympics data variables: Year, Games, Country, Medal, Event. World Events data variables: Name, Year, Month, Country, Type, Place, Impact, Effected Population, Person/Group Responsible, Outcome. We will investigate the change in medal count per country over time; overall and by event. We can use the world events data in order to find a potential cause for observed medal count changes.\n\n\n\nBig Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)\n1 . Variables: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume. We will create new variables for daily volatility and investigate the relationship between daily volatility, open price, close price, and volume of stocks. 2. Variables: Date, Close. We’ll examine how the closing price of different Big Tech companies moves together by calculating correlations between them.\n\n\nAmazon Sales Report (Amazon Sales.csv)\n\nAmazon Sales Variables: “Status”, “Order ID”. New variable created for counting unique order status is status_frequency. At first part of using data we will check if all the values in Status is clean without any duplicates or spelling errors (suppose “Shipped” or “shipped”). Next approach will be calculating the count of each Status for better understanding of their distribution. For visualization part barplot is created for visualizing the different order status. This question can help dedicated team of company to access the efficiency of the order fulfillment.\nVariables used: “Category”, “Amount”. Creates a new variable that sums up the Sale Amount for each Product Category “Total_sales_by_product”. First step will be to check if Category and amount variables don’t have missing values, especially in Amount. Then we will group data by product category(Category) and sales_amount(Amount), which will be used to rank category by total_sales_value, at this point we will have Top 3 category which has highest sales amount. At the end for visualization we will create a barplot displaying the total sales for each category, with emphasis on the top three categories. This question can help company to focus on top product category of platform and less on least popular category for revenue management."

    "text": "This project analyzes data from past Summer Olympics to explore patterns and trends in athlete performance and demographics, focusing on basketball and country-level performance. The first question investigates the evolution of basketball players’ heights over time, utilizing a density plot to visualize changes and a logistic regression model to assess how height influences the probability of winning a medal. Results reveal significant trends in player height and its relationship with competitive success. The second question examines how countries’ performance has shifted across Olympic Games, with particular attention to the potential influence of major world events. [Details about findings related to countries’ performance will be added once analysis is complete.] Together, these analyses provide insight into the interplay between individual attributes and global factors in shaping Olympic outcomes."
