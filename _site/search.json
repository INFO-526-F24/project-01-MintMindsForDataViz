The data set is 271,116 rows by 15 columns and contains data for every Olympic medal winner such as their name, sex, country, height, weight, and games they won the medal at.\nIt is important to note that winter and summer games were held in the same year up until 1992. From 1992 onward they were staggered by two years.\n\n\nBig Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)\nBit tech stock price dataset from 2023-02-07 tidytuesday. The data has 45089 rows and 8 columns. Rows has the stock stock symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj close, volume from 2010-01-04 to 2022-12-29 of the following companies: Adobe Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Salesforce, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Alphabet Inc., IBM, Intel Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Netflix, Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Tesla, Inc.\n\n\nAmazon Sales Report (Amazon Sales.csv)\nWe have taken this dataset from kaggle/e-commerce-sales-data, by Anil, and data belongs to Amazon.com. This dataset has 128975 rows and 24 column of data. This dataset provides detailed insights into Amazon sales data, including SKU Code, Design Number, Stock, Category, Size and Color, to help visualization of profitability. The dataset tracks transactions made by customers in an online retail store to analyze purchasing behavior and identify sales trends."

We will investigate the distributions of height and weight of athletes across different sports and sexes. We can also investigate if so-called “ideal” heights and weights have changed over time for each event. This question has the potential to raise ethical concerns in that anyone is able to succeed in any sport no matter their height/weight. We just want to investigate whether or not there is a historical trend of success across different events in athletes with certain heights/weights.\nOlympics data variables: Year, Games, Country, Medal, Event. World Events data variables: Name, Year, Month, Country, Type, Place, Impact, Effected Population, Person/Group Responsible, Outcome. We will investigate the change in medal count per country over time; overall and by event. We can use the world events data in order to find a potential cause for observed medal count changes.\n\n\n\nBig Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)\n1 . Variables: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume. We will create new variables for daily volatility and investigate the relationship between daily volatility, open price, close price, and volume of stocks. 2. Variables: Date, Close. We’ll examine how the closing price of different Big Tech companies moves together by calculating correlations between them.\n\n\nAmazon Sales Report (Amazon Sales.csv)\n\nAmazon Sales Variables: “Status”, “Order ID”. New variable created for counting unique order status is status_frequency. At first part of using data we will check if all the values in Status is clean without any duplicates or spelling errors (suppose “Shipped” or “shipped”). Next approach will be calculating the count of each Status for better understanding of their distribution. For visualization part barplot is created for visualizing the different order status. This question can help dedicated team of company to access the efficiency of the order fulfillment.\nVariables used: “Category”, “Amount”. Creates a new variable that sums up the Sale Amount for each Product Category “Total_sales_by_product”. First step will be to check if Category and amount variables don’t have missing values, especially in Amount. Then we will group data by product category(Category) and sales_amount(Amount), which will be used to rank category by total_sales_value, at this point we will have Top 3 category which has highest sales amount. At the end for visualization we will create a barplot displaying the total sales for each category, with emphasis on the top three categories. This question can help company to focus on top product category of platform and less on least popular category for revenue management."

    "text": "Introduction and Data\nFor our project, we have chosen to analyze Olympic data. Our motivation is to learn more about the evolution of athletes over time and which countries have dominated the games. The dataset used comes from Kaggle and describes characteristics of Olympic athletes such as name, gender, country, age, height, weight, event, and medal if applicable for every Olympic athlete from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.\nTo learn more about the evolution of athletes our first research question states: Is there any ideal height for Olympics men’s basketball and has it changed over time? To analyze the performance of different nations our second question states: How has the performance of different countries evolved and what major events influenced changes?\nTo start answering our first question we conducted exploratory data analysis and created visualizations to explore the heights of Olympic men’s basketball players over time. \nTo create the plots shown below and the ridgeline plot used to help answer our first research question we created a column displaying the height in inches by dividing the height in centimeters column by 2.54. A decade column was also created which grouped all Olympic games into their corresponding decade. A few basketball players’ heights were missing, so all athletes missing height entries were removed.\nKnowing that the average height throughout all of Olympics men’s basketball is 77 inches, we created the following visualizations:\n\nOne thing to note is that basketball did not start in the Olympics until 1936. Based on the visualization above, it is clear that the height of Olympic men’s basketball players has increased by just over 7 inches in these 80 years.\n\nThese box plots show a similar story to the bar plots above. While heights increased from 1930 through 1980, by 1990 the growth had slowed.\n\nThe line plot above displays the average height of Olympic Men’s basketball athletes since 1936. Now we can see in more detail that player heights reached a new peak in 1992 and have stayed fairly consistent since then.\n\nThe final exploratory visualization for Olympic men’s basketball player heights confirms that the average height between 1936 and 2016 is around 77 inches, or 6 feet 5 inches. It also shows the small frequency of players below 70 inches (5 feet 10 inches) and above 85 inches (7 feet 1 inch)."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe visualization used for displaying Olympic men’s basketball players’ heights over each decade is a ridge-line plot. A ridge-line plot makes it easy to see how the most common Olympic basketball player heights have increased by showing the changes in height distributions for each decade. To build the ridge-line plot we used the created height in inches and decade columns. \nThe methodology used to answer our first research question is a logistic regression model to see the probabilities of winning a medal based on height. The model will not take into account the type of medal won, but simply if a medal was won or not since a logistic regression model is used for binary classification. To create the model, we created a binary column showcasing a 1 if a medal was won and a 0 if not. We then created a data frame consisting of only heights and whether a medal was won or not. All NAs from the height column were dropped and this data frame was then split into training and testing data for the logistic regression model.\nTo answer our second research question which focuses on the distribution of medals by country, a few transformations were done. First, a data frame (medal data) showing the count of each type of medal for each country from each Olympics is shown. For example, starting in 1896 we can see the distribution of bronze, silver, gold, and total medals for each country up until 2016. Next, we had to identify the top 10 countries leading in total medals and filter so that only those countries appeared in our medal data. Finally, we created a data frame consisting of events that affected Olympic participation and the years that they occurred, so these years could be plotted. \nTo showcase medal trends over time, we created a line plot displaying the total medals for the top 10 countries. The plot also showcases the year’s major world events occurred, which can explain some fluctuations in medal counts. We chose a line plot because it effectively displays countries’ changes in medal counts over time and allows for a simple display of the world event years.\nWe also created an area chart illustrating the distribution of gold medals won by top countries. An area chart was chosen because it highlights the changes in gold medal dominance across countries and the overall growth of the Olympic games in terms of total gold medals.\nA dashboard was created to showcase all of these visualizations in one place. Although not showcased on the dashboard, in our presentation we have included an animation of medal trends over time for the top 10 countries in total medal count."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n1. Olympic Men’s Basketball Player Heights\nInsight: The most common or average height for Olympic men’s basketball players has considerably increased over the years\nKey Findings:\n\nIn the 1930’s, the common height was 6’0’’. By the 2010s, it had increased to 6 ’8”.\nThis increase highlights the evolution of player selection criteria and the growing emphasis on height as an advantage in basketball.\n\nVisualization:\nThe distribution of heights of men’s basketball players from the 1930s to 2016 is displayed in the ridge plots showing the upward shift in height distribution across decades, with annotations emphasizing the shift.\n\n\n\n2. Height and Medal-Winning probability\n\n\nInsights:\n\nHeight is a significant factor in predicting winning probability in men’s basketball, with a P-value of 6.05e- 10.\nThe odds of winning increase by 8.85% for every one-inch increase in height.\nDespite the statistical Significance, the AUC of 0.5973 indicates limited predictive power when height is used as the sole or major predictor\n\nVisualization Highlights:\n\nThe logistic regression curve shows the relationship between height and the probability of winning a medal.\nThe jittered data points introduce a little nuance to the visualization, demonstrating the model’s predictions alongside the observed data.\n\nSupporting insights:\nThe moderate AUC score illustrates the need for a multifactorial approach to athlete evaluation beyond physical phenotypes.\n\n3. Medal Trends over time (top 10 countries):\nInsight: Medal trends of the top 10 countries reflect a longitudinal dynamic of consistency in the performance of these nations, fluctuations in competitive investment, and changes in focus in coverage of various sports.\nKey Findings:\n\nThe line plot shows how the total medals won by the 10 countries were distributed along the timeline.\nSome countries are growing steadily and may remain at the transcendence of investing in athletic performance.\nChanging levels of competition or participation over decades are suggested by differences in medal counts.\n\nVisualization:\nLine Plot: The plot represents the trajectory of total medals obtained by the top countries, in an unmistakable way to identify the periods in which they grew their performance and when there were some dips. The visualization shows how dominant countries have managed to keep their edge while others have surged and fallen.\n\n4. Gold Medal Distribution:\nInsight: Gold medal dominance differs markedly from country to country with some nations displaying eras of sustained supremacy in terms of total gold medal wins.\nKey Findings:\n\nThe area chart shows the distribution of gold medals among the top-performing nations over time.\nCountries with a strategic focus on Olympic performance, like the USA and USSR, dominated certain decades.\nThere has been an increased distribution of gold medals in the last few decades, indicating increased competition, with more countries contributing to the overall medal count.\n\nVisualization:\nArea Chart: This style of chart highlights the changes in dominant gold medal-winning countries over the decades, with transitions, signaling shifts in athlete power and ever-increasing competition as the Games moved into a new area.\n\n\nDiscussions:\nMany articles drew their data from Olympic Games data, yielding deep insights into long-term trends in athletic performance and country-level dominance. The rise in the average height of men’s basketball players (from 1932 to today) is indicative of evolving athletic demands probably influenced by progress in sports science and a competitive drive for physiological optimization. Although height was found to correlate strongly with the probability of being a medal winner, the relatively low predictive power of this model (AUC = 0.5973) demonstrates that success in sports is multifactorial, involving technical skills, teamwork, and psychological resilience.\nThe patterns of medals won by the top 10 countries over the years showed an unflinching dominance of a few nations, including the United States and the former Soviet Union, but also a growing global competitiveness in the past 15 years. These trends highlight the importance of consistent investment in sports infrastructure and talent development. Long-term trends also mirror the effects of historical and geopolitical developments that have disrupted fair flows of opportunities and resources.\nThe gold medal distribution over time did show how dominance is concentrated among a select few nations, though trends in recent games suggest a move towards broadening participation and success around the world. This would mean advancement in evening out the playing field such that emerging countries can compete against long-time leading countries.\nSo while this analysis revealed several important trends and factors driving success, there still seemed to be crucial limitations. The link between height and medal success is nuanced and needs to be explored in light of a variety of other factors including economic conditions, training regimes, and the impact of particular sports disciplines. The focus on medal production by dominant countries, informative as it is, hides the achievements of athletes from less established nations who are making significant strides on the world stage.\nFuture work in this area might include exploratory analysis of non-medal performances, further analysis of the intersection between politics, economy, and sports, or dynamic tools to visualize trends in more effective ways. Such initiatives could deliver a more comprehensive perspective on the changing landscape of international sports and be transformative for countries seeking to improve their Olympic performance.\n\n\nReferences\nGriffin, R.
