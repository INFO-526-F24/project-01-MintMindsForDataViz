## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

### Olympic Data Set (athlete_events.csv)

1.  Variables: Sex, Height, Weight, Medal, Sport, Games, Year. We will investigate the distributions of height and weight of athletes across different sports and sexes. We can also investigate if so-called "ideal" heights and weights have changed over time for each event. This question has the potential to raise ethical concerns in that anyone is able to succeed in any sport no matter their height/weight. We just want to investigate whether or not there is a historical trend of success across different events in athletes with certain heights/weights.
2.  Olympics data variables: Year, Games, Country, Medal, Event. World Events data variables: Name, Year, Month, Country, Type, Place, Impact, Effected Population, Person/Group Responsible, Outcome. We will investigate the change in medal count per country over time; overall and by event. We can use the world events data in order to find a potential cause for observed medal count changes.

### Big Tech Stock Prices (big_tech_stock_prices.csv)

1 . Variables: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume. We will create new variables for daily volatility and investigate the relationship between daily volatility, open price, close price, and volume of stocks.
2.  Variables: Date, Close. Weâ€™ll examine how the closing price of different Big Tech companies moves together by calculating correlations between them.
