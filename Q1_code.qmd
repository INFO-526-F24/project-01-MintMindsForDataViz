Violin plot of height by decade for Mens basketball players

Ideas: In dashboard could filter height by country and decade

```{r}

# Visualization 1

# Load in packages
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)


#### Load in Data
olympics <- read_csv(here("data", "athlete_events.csv"))

#### Data Prep

# create decade column, years are rounded down for decade column (EX: Year=1896,Decade=1890)
olympics$Decade <- floor(olympics$Year / 10) * 10

# create height in inches column
olympics$Height_Inches <- round(olympics$Height / 2.54)

# create new df containing only basketball data
basketball <- subset(olympics, Sport == 'Basketball')

# create height in feet column
basketball$Height_Ft <- floor(basketball$Height_Inches / 12)

# create remainder of inches column
basketball$Height_Inches_Rem <- round(basketball$Height_Inches %% 12)

# filter even further for only mens basketball data
mens_basketball <- subset(basketball, Event %in% c("Basketball Men's Basketball"))

#### Olympics Men's Basketball Heights From the 2010 Decade

# create men's basketball df for 2010
mens_basketball_2010 <- subset(mens_basketball, Decade == 2010)

# violin plot
ggplot(mens_basketball, aes(x = Height_Inches, y = Decade, group = Decade)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(
    title = "Olympics Men's Basketball Player Height Distribution",
    subtitle = "2010 Decade",
    x = "Height (in)",
    y = ""
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")
```
