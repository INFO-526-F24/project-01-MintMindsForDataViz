## Abstract

This project analyzes data from past Summer Olympics to explore patterns and trends in athlete performance and demographics, focusing on basketball and country-level performance. The first question investigates the evolution of basketball players' heights over time, utilizing a density plot to visualize changes and a logistic regression model to assess how height influences the probability of winning a medal. Results reveal significant trends in player height and its relationship with competitive success. The second question examines how countries' performance has shifted across Olympic Games, with particular attention to the potential influence of major world events. \[Details about findings related to countriesâ€™ performance will be added once analysis is complete.\] Together, these analyses provide insight into the interplay between individual attributes and global factors in shaping Olympic outcomes.
